# Capstone-Project-Dark-Web-Investigation-Intelligence-Gathering

**Course:** *Introduction to Dark Web Operations*  
**Provider:** **Security Blue Team (SBT)**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This capstone project simulates a **real-world dark web investigation** conducted in a **controlled training environment**.  
The objective was to infiltrate a TOR-based hidden service and gather **actionable intelligence** on individuals involved in **drug trafficking and related cybercrime activities**.

The project emphasizes **dark web reconnaissance, intelligence extraction, and OPSEC failure analysis** rather than exploitation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Gain access to a restricted dark web service  
- Identify evidence of illegal drug trafficking  
- Discover locations and coordination points used by criminals  
- Extract intelligence hidden via encoding and steganography  
- Analyze operational security (OPSEC) failures  

---

## 🔍 Investigation Summary

### 1️⃣ Access & Authentication
- Analyzed client-side JavaScript using browser developer tools  
- Generated and decoded **Base64-encoded credentials**  
- Successfully authenticated to the hidden service  

---

### 2️⃣ Content & Post Analysis
- Decoded **hexadecimal-encoded** post titles  
- Identified pinned discussions related to:
  - **Drug distribution**
  - **Illicit pleasure services**
  - **Drop locations**

---

### 3️⃣ Criminal Network Identification
- Analyzed message board communications  
- Discovered references to a secondary illegal platform operated by the hacking group **_Midnite_**  
- Indicated collaboration between multiple criminal entities  

---

### 4️⃣ Financial Intelligence Exposure
- Investigated an exposed transaction log  
- Identified sensitive invoice information including:
  - Customer identity details  
  - Email address  
  - Purpose of transaction  
- Highlighted poor **OPSEC practices**

---

### 5️⃣ Steganography & Location Intelligence
- Extracted hidden data from an image posted by a suspect  
- Solved an embedded riddle revealing:
  - **City of an illegal gathering**
